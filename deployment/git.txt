# Git is the underlying technology behind GitHub which allows for developers to work on code in a team; pull or push code; clone to a server etc

# Initialize a repository in github.com

# Ensure you have a README.md file if you did not initialize it in the GUI.
echo "# notes" >> README.md

# Also initialize a git repo in your current application in your TERMINAL.
git init

# Add the README.md
git add README.md
git add .

# Commit the changes to the branch
git commit -m "this is my first commit"

# Add the remote desktop repository to your current application in your terminal so you can push
# I think it sort of creates a tunnel so that files can be uploaded upon a 'special' command
git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/<app_name.git>

# push the files to the repository AKA github
git push -u origin master
