# Heroku (free)

# Create an application name
heroku create <application-name>

# Push the files from git to heroku's server
git push heroku master (you change the branch to master to push the files to)

# Ensure your express framework's port number is bound to heroku's dyno
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000
app.listen(port, () => {
	console.log('Server is up and running on port', port)

# DigitalOcean (paid)

# Point domain name to DO's server IP address

# Point domain nameserver to DO's nameserver

# ssh into DO's server
ssh root@<ip_address>

# create public/private RSA key between DO server and github 
keygen...

# ensure github has a copy of the RSA key initialized in your DO instance

# Clone the files from github to DO instance
git clone <ssh-command>

# Start the application in the background using a service called 'nohup' short for nohangup
nohup node xxx.js </dev/null &>/dev/null &
nohup ruby xxx.rb
nohup python xxx.py

Note: the xxx.ext is the entry point for which your app starts. Check package.json to see your configuration

# To kill the application/nohup, find the processID and kill it
ps -ef | grep <name_of_entry_file>
eg: ps -ef | grep index.js

kill -9 <process_id>
