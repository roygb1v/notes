# Node.js
# JS-based environment to create web-servers and networked applications.
# Eg: minify JS files; compile Sass files -> CSS

# What is npm ?
# Node Package Manager that installs Node "packages" or "modules" fast and easy.
# "Package/Module" is a code library which extends Node and has useful functionality.
# The "request" module simplifies the process of making HTTP requests easily so you can get web resources from other sites.

# NPM is installed when you install Node.

# Install Node(npm). Ensure you have brew installed on your MacOS.
brew install node

# Check and test versions
npm -v
node -v

# Initialize the application using npm
npm init -y (global y flag sets default to all fields. You might want to customise some settings in package.json)

# Install packages and save to development
npm i <package_name> --save-dev
