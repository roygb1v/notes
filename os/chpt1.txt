A computer system is divided into 4 components: Hardware, OS, Application programs, User

Hardware: CPU; memory; I/O devices provides basic computing resources for the system.
Application programs: word processes; compilers; web browsers.
OS: controls the hardware and coordinates its use among the various application programs for its users.
User: self-explanatory.

OS provides an environment within which other programs can do useful work

User view: ease of use. Some attention paid to performance but none to resource utilization (i.e how hardware and software resources are shared)

Mainframe. Many users. Many terminals.
Sharing of resources. Maximise resource utilization.
Ensure all cpu time, memory, I/O used efficiently and no user has larger share of resources.

Workstations and Servers.
Dedicated resouces but share resources such as networking and servers(file, compute, print servers)



###
System view: OS => resource allocator.
Manager of these resources(CPU TIME; MEMORY SPACE; FILE-STORAGE SPACE; I/O devices)
Control program => manages execution of user programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer.

Kernel: The OS is the one program runnning at all times on the computer.
System programs: assoc with os but not nec part of kernel.
application programs: all prgs not assoc with the os.

Middleware: a set of software frameworks that provide additional services to app devs. supports db, multimedia and graphics.

Modern computer system consists of one or more CPUs and a number of device controllers connected through a common bus that provides access to shared memory.

Each device controller is in charge of a specific type of device(disk drives; audio devices; video displays)

ROM: read-only memory
