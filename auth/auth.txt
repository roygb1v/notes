You can never truly protect an API, but requiring authentication makes it a bit safer

Authentication is controlling if an incoming request can proceed or not

Authorization is controlling if an authenticated request has the correct permissions to access a resource

Identification is determining who the requester is

JWT is stateless vs cookies.

A bearer token (1 type of strat) strat that allows the API to be stateless with user auth.

Created by a combi of secrets on the API and a payload (i.e user object id)

Must be sent with every request where the API will then try to verify the token was created with the expected secrets

After successful verification, JWT payload is accessible to the server. Can be used for authorization and identification.
